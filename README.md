# FPGA
this project is for the INFLUENZA MODEL mentioned in the pdf paper.
i have added a pdf file to explane why i did it this way. 
however; their is a wrong move i have done, i shouldn't do +1, not because of the termination error, my variable is already 32 bit so this is not the problem. 
instead of adding one we should add the variable itself i.e., w2. this is shown in the pdf explantion file.
