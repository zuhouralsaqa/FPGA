This project is for the INFLUENCE MODEL mentioned in the pdf paper.
I have added a pdf file to explain why I did it this way. 
however; there is a wrong move I shouldn't do +1, not because of the termination error, my variable is already 32 bit so this is not the problem. 
instead of adding one, we should add the variable itself i.e., w2. this is shown in the pdf explanation file.
